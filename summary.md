"An Ansible Development Stack"

A warm and fuzzy overview of the various parts of the new development and deployment stack used to configure and maintain MCIN workstations configurations.

Highlights of interest include an overview of Virtualization types, including VM's and containers, as well as the benefits and drawbacks of various Virtualization targets.

The talk will include one or more live demo's of our shiny new stack in action and the high level of abstraction it provides for configuring and testing bare-metal, virtual machine, cloud and container based targets.
